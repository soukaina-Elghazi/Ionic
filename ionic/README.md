## Build a Complete Ionic Firebase App

In this ionic firebase tutorial we will show you how to create a firebase application to perform all CRUD operations in an ionic application.

In this ionic example you will see how to Create, Read, Update and Delete tasks using Firebase Firestore Database.

As a bonus you will also learn how to use Firebase Storage to store images or files from your Ionic app and link them to a specific user.

**You can use this FREE Ionic Firebase Starter App as a base to create your Ionic App with Firebase backend.**
